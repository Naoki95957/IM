An extremely basic LAN chat "Instant Messaging" thing. Connects a single
client to a server.

I have developed a public version to connect up to 16 clients to a server
by multi-threading it. I'd like to expand it's capability to a larger capacity
and am currently working re-opening a closed connection. It has proper host
priorities as it does kick, identify and read avalible clients (updated as 
of 12/13/2014: it can mute clients, PM, reset/set names, and copy the entire
chat to a txt at a directory and name of choice. It additionally loads saved
conversations and will send the loaded conversation to anyone who joins so that
they don't miss out on anything :). I have yet to establish white/black listing
and recording IP's/usernames. Eventually I hope to eventually create some sort
of logging in. It is a fun success :tada: and I don't plan on exposing it till I 
feel done with it. And I mean done as in I don't care. For now, I really enjoy
messing with it.
