An extremely basic LAN chat "Instant Messaging" thing. Connects a single
client to a server.

I have developed a public version to connect up to 16 clients to a server
by multi-threading it. I'd like to expand it's capability to a larger capacity
and am currently working re-opening a closed connection. It has proper host
priorities as it does kick, identify and read avalible clients (updated as 
of 12/13/2014: it can mute clients, PM, reset/set names, and copy the entire
chat to a txt at a directory and name of choice... :/ still yet to figure out 
closing/opening). It is a fun success and I don't plan on exposing it till I 
feel done with it. And I mean done as in I don't care. For now, I really enjoy
messing with it.

  I have a little bit of pride to it and I don't want to overexpose it or 
abuse it. It has been a project, not an app or a game. It is however not
possible without clients and wouldn't be useful if it weren't for chatting.
