An extremely basic attempt to make a LAN chat "Instant Messaging" thing.
I have developed a public version to connect up to 16 clients to a server
by multi-threading it. I've yet to properly close the program because 
the method I planned to use was depracated... I guess that makes me dangerous XD.
