An extremely basic LAN chat "Instant Messaging" thing. Connects a single
client to a already waiting and made server.

I have developed a public version to connect up to 16 clients to a server
by multi-threading it. I'd like to expand it's capability to a larger capacity
and am currently working re-opening a closed connection. It has proper host
priorities as it does, kick, identify and read avalible clients. It is a fun
success and I don't plan on exposing it till I feel done with it. And I mean
done as in I don't care. For now, I really enjoy messing with it.
  I have a little bit of pride to it and I don't want to overexpose it or 
abuse it. It has been a project, not an app or a game.
